# Ministry Books Scrape


Behold the power of web scraping!


## Instructions 

 - Download the necessary Selenium webdriver (chromedriver) and save to your Downloads folder
   - Make sure to edit the permissions on the chromedriver so it can be executed as a file
 - Adjust the variables within the script file to target a specific book on ministrybooks.org
 - Make sure you use pip or pip3 to install the necessary packages
 - Run with `python [file.py]` or `python3 [file.py]`


## Important Note:

Depending on the type of OS you use and the web browser you use, you need to download a driver in order to run the selenium webdriver. Since I use Chrome, I need to check what version of Chrome I am running.
